There are several advanced machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks. Below, I'll list some of the key algorithms and provide example Python code for each.

### 1. **Linear Regression**
   - **Overview:** A basic linear approach to model the relationship between the dependent variable and independent variables.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 2. **Ridge Regression**
   - **Overview:** A linear regression model with L2 regularization to prevent overfitting.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge

   model = Ridge(alpha=1.0)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 3. **Lasso Regression**
   - **Overview:** A linear regression model with L1 regularization that can shrink coefficients to zero, leading to feature selection.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso

   model = Lasso(alpha=1.0)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 4. **Elastic Net**
   - **Overview:** Combines L1 and L2 regularization. Itâ€™s useful when there are multiple correlated features.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import ElasticNet

   model = ElasticNet(alpha=1.0, l1_ratio=0.5)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
   - **Overview:** Uses a version of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for regression problems.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.svm import SVR

   model = SVR(kernel='rbf', C=1.0, epsilon=0.1)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 6. **Decision Tree Regression**
   - **Overview:** A non-linear regression method that splits the data into different segments based on decision rules.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor

   model = DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=5)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 7. **Random Forest Regression**
   - **Overview:** An ensemble method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to improve accuracy and robustness.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor

   model = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, max_depth=5)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 8. **Gradient Boosting Regression**
   - **Overview:** Builds trees sequentially, each one trying to correct the errors of the previous one, often leading to better accuracy than a single decision tree.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor

   model = GradientBoostingRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 9. **XGBoost**
   - **Overview:** An efficient and scalable implementation of gradient boosting, often leading to superior performance in many datasets.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   import xgboost as xgb

   model = xgb.XGBRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 10. **LightGBM**
   - **Overview:** A gradient boosting framework that uses tree-based learning algorithms and is designed for high performance and fast computation.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   import lightgbm as lgb

   model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=100, learning_rate=0.1, max_depth=3)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 11. **CatBoost**
   - **Overview:** A gradient boosting algorithm that handles categorical variables automatically and provides strong performance.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from catboost import CatBoostRegressor

   model = CatBoostRegressor(iterations=100, learning_rate=0.1, depth=3)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, verbose=False)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 12. **Polynomial Regression**
   - **Overview:** Extends linear regression by considering polynomial relationships between features.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

   poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
   X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X_train)

   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X_poly, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(poly.transform(X_test))
   ```

### 13. **Bayesian Ridge Regression**
   - **Overview:** A linear regression model with a Bayesian approach to regularization.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.linear_model import BayesianRidge

   model = BayesianRidge()
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 14. **K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)**
   - **Overview:** Predicts the value by averaging the values of the nearest neighbors.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsRegressor

   model = KNeighborsRegressor(n_neighbors=5)
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### 15. **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)**
   - **Overview:** A neural network-based approach for complex regression tasks.
   - **Code:**
   ```python
   from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential
   from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense

   model = Sequential()
   model.add(Dense(64, input_dim=X_train.shape[1], activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))
   model.add(Dense(1))

   model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='mean_squared_error')
   model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=100, batch_size=10, verbose=0)
   y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

### Summary:
- Each of these algorithms is suitable for different types of regression problems, depending on the nature of the data and the complexity of the relationships you need to model.
- Some models are linear, while others are non-linear or ensemble-based, offering different levels of interpretability, performance, and robustness.

These examples provide a foundation to implement various advanced regression techniques in Python. You can experiment with different algorithms to find the best one for your specific dataset.
